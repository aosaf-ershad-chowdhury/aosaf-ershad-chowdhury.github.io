<h1>Portfolio Website</h1>

This repository will function to run my portfolio website which can be found at https://aosaf-ershad-chowdhury.github.io/

HTML, CSS and JavaScript were used to make the site. I also used Bootstrap5 for ease in making this site. A custom css file can be found in the css folder and all the images used (under fair copyright use) can be found in the images folder.

I have tried to make this website accessible to as many people as possible and have met most of the requirements of the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool. I also tried my best to meet the advice given in the WebAIM website. All the HTML and CSS (non-minified) used have been validated using the Nu Html Checker and the CSS Validator. Please note that the minified codes may give warnings during validation checks due to the process by which they are minified.

***Please note that this branch contains the optimized HTML and CSS code that was produced after minifying the original codes for Search Engine Optimization (SEO). You can find the original non-optimized code in the other branch***
