<h1>Portfolio Website</h1>

This repository will function to run my portfolio website which can be found at https://aosaf-ershad-chowdhury.github.io/

HTML, CSS and JavaScript were used to make the site. I also used Bootstrap5 for ease in making this site. A custom css file can be found in the css folder and all the images used (under fair copyright use) can be found in the images folder.

***Please note that this branch contains the non-optimized (not minified) HTML and CSS***
